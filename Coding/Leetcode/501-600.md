# 561. Array Partition I
## 题目
Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
<pre>
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.
</pre>
Note:
n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

## 代码
<pre>
class Solution(object):
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        sum = 0
        nums.sort()
        for i in range (0, len(nums) - 1, 2):
            sum += nums[i]
        return sum
</pre>

## 思路
先排序，然后两两分为一组，证明待续。
